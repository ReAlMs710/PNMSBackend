# OPENDOOR IS DEAD!!!
# Project Name: OpenDoor
## Project Description
### Create a service that helps low-income students with a lack of resources be able to learn English in America
- An AI chatbot using ChatGPT API will teach the user a lesson based on all of their preferences and native language
- Created by Neil Kumaran, Mano Wertman, Pranav Pramod, and Stratton Jelley.
- As of now. OpenDoor is discontinued indefinitely, and will probably never be back online. You can run it yourself, and even add on if you wanna.
- This was a really fun project to work on, and it taught me a lot. I maybe would've made this better if I didn't have other work.
